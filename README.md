    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p style='font-size:16px'>As a kid, I remember sitting next to my dad at night, fascinated by his job. The ability to create things out of code lines connected with me as a paint-brush connects to an artist. When I was about 10, I remember trying to write my first programs in Java. Finishing up my calculator was something I will never forget.<br><br>Starting college, I was always ahead of the class, reading 5 chapters of the book in advance of every class, so I could solve the problems with some new unique technique I've just learned.<br><br>As the years went by, the problems got trickier. The industry made me adapt myself, learn new things; and if my teammates ask me how I learn so fast, I just say that I believe I love this more then anybody else.</p>
